Thanks for purchase Loading Effect!.

- Get Started:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Import the package into the unity project from the asset store.
- Open example scenes for check the ready made prefabs preview.

- Usage:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- If you want use a ready made prefab of package, you only need drag this into the scene canvas and reposition
exactly where you want to show and assign a UNIQUE 'ID' (in the inspector of bl_LoadingEffect).
now you only need tell when show loading and when hide, just need one line of code for it, example:

in a script of scene (create one if not have yet) when you want to show just call like this:

  bl_LoadingUtils.GetLoading(ID).isLoading = true;//where 'ID' is the unique id assign in the inspector of loading effect target.

and for hide: 

  bl_LoadingUtils.GetLoading(ID).isLoading = false;//where 'ID' is the unique id assign in the inspector of loading effect target.

- Create a new loading effect:------------------------------------------------------------------------

- if you want create a new style loading, you simple need a ready made prefab of package and customize it,
play with the settings avaible and reach the style that you want.
